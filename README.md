## 🧠 How it Works

1. User uploads an image through the web UI.
2. The image is sent to a Flask backend.
3. OpenCV processes the image:
   - Converts to grayscale
   - Inverts the image
   - Applies Gaussian blur
   - Combines with original grayscale to create a pencil sketch
4. The sketch is returned to the frontend for viewing and download.
